### What is a hackathon
A Hackathon is an event where people(mostly hackers) gather together to intensively 'hack' on certain topics under time constraints, where the final projects are not necessarily refined and concept-proving prototypes are totally acceptable. As a mean of inspiration and innovation, a hackathon is very flexible and almost everything can be the topic and we have seen lots of great hacks in developer communities, schools and companies, like:

- **technical** hacks on blockchain, cyber security, IOT, Web 3.0, repo bug fixing, ect;
- **cross-disciplined** hacks on wearable devices, art installations, rural education, ect;
- **fun** hacks on Halloween, Mario games, ect;


### The Goal of a Hackathon
With the flexibility of hackathons, the goal of a specific hackathon can be quite diversified. The most commonly recognized  objective are **to build** and **to communicate**.

- **⚙️To Build** - Some hacks are intended to discuss or resolve specific problems, like cyber security contests, Web 3.0 applications, repo bug fixing and so on, where we see a lot of brilliant ideas and prototypes being developed yet later grow into valuable companies and/or products. 
- **📢To communicate** - Hackathons can also serve as a means of gathering talents and communicating. For innovative and passionate participants with solid technical skills, hackathons will provide them great opportunities to demonstrate their capabilities and projects, exchange ideas, make friends and find partners.
