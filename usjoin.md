Hackathon DAO is a decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations. 

To financially and operationally support and liberate global hackers and hackathon organizers (especially open-source repo maintainers) and focus on truly valuable technical problems and improvements, we 
- Hold seasonal grants to fund meaningful hackathons. 
- Maintain a hackathon playbook to share (almost) everything about hackathons.
- Organize an online community of top hackers and hackathon organizers to actively discuss the (most) valuable tech problems and innovations.

Hackathon has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. Through funding Hackathons, we want to gather a group of enthusiastic hackers with great technical skills and vision and further boost the open-source community and innovations, where
- Hackers themselves can propose and decide what are the real problems to solve.
- Hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
- Valuable contributions will be supported financially and operationally.

Please do join us if you if you also enjoy the excitement of Hackathon and believe in its capability of boosting creativity and communication.Hackathon DAO will make our best effort to decentralize and amplify that!!!

A community can‚Äôt be driven without a shared common vision.
