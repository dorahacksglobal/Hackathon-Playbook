Hackathon DAO is a decentralized community to support global hackathons on meaningful technical problems and innovations.

- Hold seasonal grants to fund meaningful hackathons. 
- Maintain a hackathon playbook to share (almost) everything about hackathons.
- Organize an online community of top hackers and hackathon organizers to actively discuss the (most) valuable tech problems and innovations.

## How to Join
Hackathon has undoubtedly proven its capability of boosting innovation and cooperation. Through funding Hackathons, we want to gather a group of enthusiastic hackers with great technical skills and vision and further boost the open-source community and innovations, where
- Hackers themselves can propose and decide what are the real problems to solve.
- Hackers can connect with and inspire each other.
- Valuable contributions will be supported financially and operationally.

Please do join us if you share the same belief with us!!!
A community can’t be driven without a shared common vision.

### **➔Apply for Our Seasonal Hackathon Grant**

**First of all, Hackathon DAO’s grant is for Hackathon, and it’s open for everyone to apply.**

Our grant will happen on a quarterly basis and each grant program will last for 3 months. An agenda will be published ahead of the beginning of each season and simplified steps would be: 1) application, 2) community voting, 3) hacking, 4) grant release and 5) reviewing. 

With these goals in mind, hackathons meet the following criteria are more than welcome to apply :
- The organizer is a maintainer of an active Github repo.
- The hackathon must have a clear and specific problem to solve instead of aimlessly exploring.
- The hackathon must have a budget plan if the grant will be used for anything other than bonus.
- The hackathon must happen during the indicated “Hacking” time window according to the posted agenda at the beginning of each season.
- The organizer has passed Hackathon DAO KYC and is not on the blacklist of Hackathon DAO.
- The hackathon needs to be organized ONLY through HackerLink platform using its bounty or hackathon feature.
Hackathon DAO is currently focused on Web3, Cryptography and Quantum Computing. But Hackathons in other fields are also welcomed to apply. 

Our next grant will be happening soon, please follow our 👉[Twitter][Twitter]👈 or join our 👉[Discord][Discord]👈 to get the latest updates. A Hackathon proposal needs to be submitted as a BUIDL on HackerLink with all information properly filled in then.

Each season, Hackathon DAO will hold a grant for each focus area with an independent funding pool. After the application deadline, our voting token holders will decide which proposals to support using quadratic voting. After submitting your proposal, please keep an eye on our Discord and your email to check the final result. Our staff will follow up with you for more details if you get the grant.
