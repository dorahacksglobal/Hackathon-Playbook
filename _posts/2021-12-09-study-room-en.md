We believe **most of the information is already on the Internet, yet needed to be surfaced and organized to become the real knowledge.** Leveraging the power of DAO, we want to create a knowledge repo and catalog on **Web3.0**, **cryptography** and **quantum computing**, and help more developers onboard these areas. 

The content we are looking for are:
- Introduction on basic concept and mechanism 
- Introduction on popular infrastructure and projects
- Developing tools
- Guide on commonly used coding languages
- Hands-on projects instructions 
- Recommended reading list
- Recommended online cources

> If you have anything to share, please submit a PR to ðŸ‘‰[**this repo**][repo]ðŸ‘ˆ and our staff will help to review. Once you PR is merged, you will get ðŸ’°50 USDTðŸ’° as bonus. Looking foward for your contribution!
